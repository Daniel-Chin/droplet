Introduction 
    (literature context. make reader understand what we do in the big picture)
    problem formulation
    what has been done so far
    what we do that hasn't been done so far

Conclusion
Limitations:
    resampling keeps sharp edges

proposed methods:
    contact line problem and the dynamic sliding regime
    stepwise interface re-sampling
    Boundary splicing

Hybrid paper. 
We have novel methods. 
Vary parameters. Do experiments with our method!
