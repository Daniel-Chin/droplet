convergence_space_1:
    Vanilla NS solver. no IBM. 
    From left to right: N = 64, 128, 196
    Result: converge.

convergence_space_2:
    Vanilla NS solver. no IBM. Add external force. 
    From left to right: N = 64, 128, 196
    Result: converge.

convergence_space_3:
    2D point matrix force spreading. 
    From left to right: N = 64, 96, 128
    Result: DOES NOT converge.

convergence_space_4:
    IBM force spreading from tension surface. 
    It's like 1D point array force spreading. 
    From left to right: N = 64, 128, 196
    Result: DOES NOT converge.

convergence_space_5:
    1D point ring force spreading. 
    From left to right: N = 64, 128, 196
    Result: DOES NOT converge.

convergence_space_6:
    IBM force spreading from tension surface. 
    Instead of spreading with dtheta, spread with 0.01.
    From left to right: N = 64, 128, 196
    Result: Converge!!!!
    Comment: How???
