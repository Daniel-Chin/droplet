## ABSTRACT
In this work, we use the immersed boundary method with four extensions to simulate a moving liquid–gas interface on a solid surface. We first define a moving contact line model and implements a static-dynamic friction condition at the immersed solid boundary. The dynamic contact angle is endogenous instead of prescribed, and the solid boundary can be non-stationary with respect to time. Second, we simulate both a surface tension force and a Young's force with one general equation that does not involve estimating local curvature. In the third extension, we splice liquid–gas interfaces to handle topological changes, such as the coalescence and separation of liquid droplets or gas bubbles. Finally, we re-sample liquid–gas interface markers to ensure a near-uniform distribution without exerting artificial forces. We demonstrate empirical convergence of our methods on non-trivial examples and apply them to several benchmark cases, including a slipping droplet on a wall and a rising bubble.
